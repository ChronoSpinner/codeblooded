ðŸŒ¾ Sugarcane Quality Marketplace
An AI-powered web platform that enables farmers to upload sugarcane quality and quantity data, and allows buyers to purchase sugarcane based on its predicted grade and price. Built using React + JavaScript frontend, a database-backed backend, and a machine learning pipeline that analyses NIR spectroscopy data (900â€“1700 nm) to estimate sugar content.

ðŸ›’ Key Features
ðŸ”¬ For Farmers
Upload sugarcane data via CSV or form

Get automated prediction of Total Sugar (TS%)

Receive a quality grade and price recommendation

List batches on the marketplace in real time

ðŸ“ˆ For Buyers
Browse sugarcane lots by:

Quality Grade (Aâ€“D)

Predicted TS%
Price per ton
Buy directly from farmers
View quantity and location before purchase

ðŸ¤– Machine Learning
Uses NIR (Near-Infrared) spectroscopy features (900â€“1700 nm)
Trained with Partial Least Squares Regression (PLS)
Categorizes sugarcane into percentile-based grades
Predicts price dynamically based on quality
